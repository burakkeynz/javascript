## OOP & Application Structure

Forkify follows an **MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture**, ensuring modular and scalable development.

### **1. Model (Data Management)**
- **`model.js`** → Handles API requests & state management.
- Fetches recipes from the API and processes data for the UI.

### **2. Views (User Interface)**
Handles all UI rendering and DOM interactions.

- **`recipeView.js`** → Displays selected recipe details.
- **`resultsView.js`** → Manages search results.
- **`bookmarksView.js`** → Handles bookmarked recipes.
- **`paginationView.js`** → Manages pagination UI.
- **`addRecipeView.js`** → Handles form submission for custom recipes.

### 📌 **3. Controller (App Logic)**
- **`controller.js`** → The brain of the application.
- Bridges the **Model** and **View** by handling user interactions.
